# Flashcards

### Abstract:

[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

This app simulates a set of flash cards through the command line! A user can see the questions, make guesses & see a final score at the end of the round.

Throughout the development process, I used TDD to drive the implementation of code wherever applicable.

### Installation Instructions:

[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

> [!WARNING]
> **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) are required to run this app.**<br>
> _Please ensure you have both installed on your machine before proceeding._

### Preview of App:

[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:

[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)

This project was completed during the 7th week of instruction during Turing's FE Software Development Bootcamp. TDD did slow down development, but also ensured code remained functional during all development & refactors. It took myself roughly 4 days or 15 hours to complete this console app.

### Contributors:

[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to their GitHubs.)

### Learning Goals:

[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

- Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle).
- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD & the [Chai Assertion Library](https://www.chaijs.com/).

### Wins + Challenges:

[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

- This app has complete test-coverage for the JS gamne logic functions.
- JS ES6 features are used wherever it is applicable.
